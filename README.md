ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS special_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lead_quality TEXT CHECK (lead_quality IN ('good', 'ok', 'spam')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS analyzed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Create index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversations_lead_quality ON conversations(lead_quality);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversations_analyzed_at ON conversations(analyzed_at);
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Make sure you have the following environment variables set in your Vercel deployment:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role key

## API Endpoints

## Technical Details

### System Prompt

The analysis uses a carefully crafted system prompt that instructs the AI to:

1. Extract specific customer information fields
2. Format responses as JSON
3. Assess lead quality based on contact information provided
4. Handle edge cases and missing information gracefully

### Database Schema

The conversations table includes these new columns:

- `customer_name` (TEXT)
- `customer_email` (TEXT)
- `customer_phone` (TEXT)
- `customer_industry` (TEXT)
- `customer_problem` (TEXT)
- `customer_availability` (TEXT)
- `customer_consultation` (BOOLEAN)
- `special_notes` (TEXT)
- `lead_quality` (TEXT - 'good', 'ok', 'spam')
- `analyzed_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Analysis fails**: Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
2. **Database errors**: Ensure the migration script has been run in Supabase
3. **Missing analysis button**: Refresh the dashboard after running the migration

### Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- OpenAI API failures
- Database connection issues
- Invalid conversation IDs
- JSON parsing errors

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints include CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- Input validation is performed on all API endpoints
- Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
